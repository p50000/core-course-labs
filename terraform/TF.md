## Best practices for Terraform

1. Used `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` for checking style.
2. Used variables to make customization easier and separate from sensitive information
3. Utilized version constraintsfor every provider described in .tf files
4. Used environmental variables for security
5. Used gitignore for terraform-specific files

r-shakirova-osx:terraform r-shakirova$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding kreuzwerker/docker versions matching "~> 3.0.1"...
- Installing kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2...
- Installed kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2 (self-signed, key ID BD080C4571C6104C)

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has made some changes to the provider dependency selections recorded
in the .terraform.lock.hcl file. Review those changes and commit them to your
version control system if they represent changes you intended to make.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
r-shakirova-osx:terraform r-shakirova$  terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # docker_container.nginx will be created

r-shakirova-osx:terraform r-shakirova$     terraform state show
Exactly one argument expected.
Usage: terraform [global options] state show [options] ADDRESS

  Shows the attributes of a resource in the Terraform state.

  This command shows the attributes of a single resource in the Terraform
  state. The address argument must be used to specify a single resource.
  You can view the list of available resources with "terraform state list".

Options:

  -state=statefile    Path to a Terraform state file to use to look
                      up Terraform-managed resources. By default it will
                      use the state "terraform.tfstate" if it exists.

r-shakirova-osx:terraform r-shakirova$     terraform state listx
Usage: terraform [global options] state <subcommand> [options] [args]

  This command has subcommands for advanced state management.

  These subcommands can be used to slice and dice the Terraform state.
  This is sometimes necessary in advanced cases. For your safety, all
  state management commands that modify the state create a timestamped
  backup of the state prior to making modifications.

  The structure and output of the commands is specifically tailored to work
  well with the common Unix utilities such as grep, awk, etc. We recommend
  using those tools to perform more advanced state tasks.

Subcommands:
    list                List resources in the state
    mv                  Move an item in the state
    pull                Pull current state and output to stdout
    push                Update remote state from a local state file
    replace-provider    Replace provider in the state
    rm                  Remove instances from the state
    show                Show a resource in the state
